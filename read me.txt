Title: Anti-Debugger for SoftIce, Win32Dasm and Other Disassemblers.

This code attempts to detect and disable the following:
(If it can't disable, it'll just quit)
Win32Dasm, Debuggy, OllyDBG, 
ProcDump, SoftSnoop, TimeFix, TMR Ripper Studio, Regmon and Filemon. 
It also attempts to add protection against other step-debugging applications. 
(TimeFix-kill used before this check too!!)
